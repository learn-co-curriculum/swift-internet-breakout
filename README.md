### Quick Summary

The Flatiron Company has hired [Insert Your Team Name] agency to build our new super duper Weather application. $$$.



You will be building a simple weather application using the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev/docs/forecast). This application should contain a tab bar controller that shows separate tabs for today's weather, daily forecast and hourly forecast. Below is a very simple example of what it could look like but you should come up with something new and unique.

Make sure to first read through some of their docs to get a sense as to how to work with their API. Also, you should register an account with them (this is usually a requirement when working with third party API's). [Link](https://darksky.net/dev/register) to register an account.



### Instructions

This lab requires you to use your prior knowledge on using the internet and calling APIs. 

Be sure to use Postman to query the DarkySky API. 

Create the appropriate classes for the DataStore, APIClient, Forecast etc. This lab is aimed at challenging you to come up with your own solutions.

Focus on the API calls **first** and then begin working on the UI. 

The API requires you to include latitude and longitude. We have included the code to do so in the lab already.
